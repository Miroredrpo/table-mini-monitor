## 11/1/2025 - Formulation of the idea and Starting the code !!  

I was just sitting browsing some sensors online when  the oled caught my eye, and I wanted a table clock to check the time and  date without having to turn on my screen all the time, and I also wanted a temperature monitor for my room so I thought why not make something that may help many people so i came up with the idea for this mini monitor,


I just started the code and have decided on which libraries to use.
