## 11/1/2025 7 PM - Formulation of the idea and Starting the code !!  

I was just sitting browsing some sensors online when  the oled caught my eye, and I wanted a table clock to check the time and  date without having to turn on my screen all the time, and I also wanted a temperature monitor for my room so I thought why not make something that may help many people so i came up with the idea for this mini monitor,


I just started the code and have decided on which libraries to use.

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Finished the code !! & started on the 3d model !  

I just completed writing and compiling the code to make sure it works, I have made 15 cool animations as screen savers so when you leave you table you can just go to that page and it will sync different animations avoiding oled burns,

I also started working on a 3d model and sketching a blueprint on how how everything goes together
