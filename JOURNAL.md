## 11/1/2025 7 PM - Formulation of the idea and Starting the code !!  

I was just sitting browsing some sensors online when  the oled caught my eye, and I wanted a table clock to check the time and  date without having to turn on my screen all the time, and I also wanted a temperature monitor for my room so I thought why not make something that may help many people so i came up with the idea for this mini monitor,


I just started the code and have decided on which libraries to use.

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Finished the code !! & started on the 3d model !  

I just completed writing and compiling the code to make sure it works, I have made 15 cool animations as screen savers so when you leave you table you can just go to that page and it will sync different animations avoiding oled burns,

I also started working on a 3d model and sketching a blueprint on how how everything goes together 

  

## 11/1/2025 10 PM - Finished the 3d model and the blue print !!  

I just completed the 3d model of the table monitor, I just put together how components will be placed on a breadboard and how much footprint they will consume, everything will be on top of the breadboard. Now I will move on to the schematics of the project!

Here is the blueprint sketch of the 3d model!!!
